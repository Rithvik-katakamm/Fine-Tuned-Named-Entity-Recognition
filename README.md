- **Procedures**: Surgical, diagnostic, and therapeutic procedures

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Loading**: MIMIC-III clinical notes from pickle format
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Clinical abbreviation expansion and normalization
3. **Batch Processing**: Memory-efficient processing in configurable batches
4. **Entity Extraction**: Clinical NER with confidence scoring
5. **Medical Filtering**: Focus on clinically relevant entities
6. **Results Export**: Structured CSV output with detailed statistics

## 📊 Dataset

**MIMIC-III Clinical Database**
- **Source**: MIMIC-III NOTEEVENTS table

- **Format**: Pandas DataFrame stored as pickle file
- **Categories**: Discharge summaries, progress notes, nursing notes, radiology reports

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Rithvik-katakamm/Fine-Tuned-Named-Entity-Recognition.git
cd Fine-Tuned-Named-Entity-Recognition

# Run setup script
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Process 10,000 notes with SciSpaCy clinical model
python run_ner.py

# Process all notes
python run_ner.py --sample-size -1

# Use baseline model for faster processing
python run_ner.py --model baseline

# Custom configuration
python run_ner.py --sample-size 5000 --model scispacy --output my_results.csv
```

### Configuration
Edit `config.py` to customize:
```python
SAMPLE_SIZE = 10000          # Number of notes to process
PRIMARY_MODEL = "scispacy"   # Model selection
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7   # Minimum entity confidence
BATCH_SIZE = 100            # Processing batch size
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics
